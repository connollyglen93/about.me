Since I first started writing code, I have always been fascinated by what is possible through software. I am also very good at finding the exciting within the most dull development projects, and I think that's what makes me a great software developer. No matter how mundane the project, I find utter enjoyment in implementing an excellent solution. I am doing what I love for a living."
